**DESCRIPTION**:
Big data analysis involves processing and analyzing large volumes of data to extract insights. Here are some key tools used for big data analysis:

1. Data Storage & Processing
Hadoop – Open-source framework for distributed storage and processing (HDFS, MapReduce).
Apache Spark – Faster alternative to Hadoop for large-scale data processing.
Apache Flink – Real-time stream processing engine.
Dask – Parallel computing in Python for large datasets.
2. Data Querying & Databases
SQL-based tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery) – Structured data querying.
NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase) – Handling unstructured and semi-structured data.
3. Data Integration & ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Apache NiFi – Automates data movement between systems.
Talend – Open-source ETL tool for data integration.
Apache Kafka – Real-time data streaming platform.
Airflow – Workflow orchestration for data pipelines.
4. Data Analysis & Machine Learning
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) – Data manipulation and machine learning.
R – Statistical analysis and visualization.
Apache Mahout – Scalable machine learning algorithms.
H2O.ai – Open-source machine learning for big data.
